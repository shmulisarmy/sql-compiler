In this project, I use comments to document assumptions about the program’s state. For example, I may take pointers to elements in an array, which is usually unsafe, but a comment might say it’s safe because the array is capped at a fixed size. These comments can become outdated as the code changes. I want you to scan the code for assumption comments, monitor the relevant code areas, and alert me whenever a change could make a comment’s assumption invalid. To find comments in this codebase, use a tool like grep or rg with "//". The location of each comment matters, as the nearby code may provide important context for the assumption.
